As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, I would measure the success of the Instagram TV product using a combination of metrics, including:

Engagement: This includes metrics such as views, likes, comments, and shares. Engagement rate is a particularly important metric, as it shows the percentage of viewers who interacted with a video

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('igtv_engagement.csv')

# Calculate the engagement rate
engagement_rate = (data['likes'] + data['comments']) / data['views']

# Print the engagement rate
print('Engagement rate:', engagement_rate)

```

Retention: This metric measures how many viewers watched a video from start to finish. A high retention rate indicates that viewers are interested in the content and watching it all the way through.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('igtv_retention.csv')

# Calculate the retention rate
retention_rate = np.sum(data['retention_time'] >= data['video_length']) / len(data)

# Print the retention rate
print('Retention rate:', retention_rate)

``

Growth: This metric measures how many new users are watching IGTV videos and how often they are returning to watch more.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('igtv_growth.csv')

# Calculate the growth rate
growth_rate = (data['new_users'] + data['returning_users']) / data['total_users']

# Print the growth rate
print('Growth rate:', growth_rate)

```

Audience: This metric measures the demographics and interests of IGTV viewers. Understanding the audience allows Instagram to create content and features that are relevant and engaging.


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('igtv_audience.csv')

# Create a bar chart of the audience demographics
plt.bar(data['demographic'], data['count'])
plt.xlabel('Demographic')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Instagram TV Audience Demographics')
plt.show()

```

In addition to these core metrics, I would also track a number of secondary metrics, such as:

Average video length: This metric can help Instagram understand how long viewers are willing to watch IGTV videos.
Time of day: This metric can help Instagram understand when viewers are most likely to watch IGTV videos.
Video type: This metric can help Instagram understand what types of videos viewers are most interested in.
Hashtags: This metric can help Instagram understand what topics viewers are interested in watching on IGTV.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('igtv_secondary_metrics.csv')

# Calculate the average video length
average_video_length = np.mean(data['video_length'])

# Print the average video length
print('Average video length:', average_video_length)

# Calculate the time of day with the most viewers
time_of_day_with_most_viewers = data['time_of_day'].mode()

# Print the time of day with the most viewers
print('Time of day with the most viewers:', time_of_day_with_most_viewers)

# Calculate the most popular video type
most_popular_video_type = data['video_type'].mode()

# Print the most popular video type
print('Most popular video type:', most_popular_video_type)

# Calculate the most popular hashtags
most_popular_hashtags = data['hashtags'].value_counts().index[0:10]

# Print the most popular hashtags
print('Most popular hashtags:', most_popular_hashtags)

```

By tracking these metrics, I would be able to get a holistic view of how IGTV is performing and identify areas where improvement is needed. For example, if I see that engagement rates are low for a certain type of video, I could recommend that Instagram produce less of that type of content. Or, if I see that viewers are dropping off halfway through a video, I could recommend that Instagram produce shorter videos or add more engaging content to the beginning of videos.

Ultimately, the goal of measuring the success of IGTV is to help Instagram create a product that people love to use. By understanding how people are interacting with IGTV, Instagram can make informed decisions about how to improve the product and make it more engaging for users.
